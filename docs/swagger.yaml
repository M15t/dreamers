  description: A poetic web experience where visitors send anonymous stories to the
    stars. Built with Echo framework in Go, Dreamers displays a night sky where stars
    hold personal narratives. Each page refresh repositions the stars randomly, creating
    a celestial sanctuary for shared stories that can only be discovered by chanceâ€”your
    stories remain safely hidden among the stars.
